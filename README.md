Problem-1: Sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively. You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0] 
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1] 
Output: [0,1,2]

Constraints:

n == nums.length 1 <= n <= 300 nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

Problem-2: Kth Largest Element in an Array

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element. Can you solve it without sorting?

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2 
Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4 
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
